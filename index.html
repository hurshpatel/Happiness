<p>This project is a smiley face which you can manipulate with certain finger gestures on the screen. The core of this project (the smiley and happiness of it) is used in another project of mine, called "Psychologist" so I will not go too much into detail on this.</p>

<h3>
<a id="App" class="anchor" href="#App" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The App Itself</h3>

<p>The interface is simple: it is just a smiley face. There are only two things you can do with it, which is change its "smileyness" and change its size. By dragging up and down, you can change the happiness of the smiley to make him happier or sadder, respectively. By using two fingers and pinching in or out you can make it smaller or bigger, respectively. Below are some demos of this in action. </p>
